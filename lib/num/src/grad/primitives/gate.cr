# A Gate is an object that can cache the result of an operation,
# as well as backpropogate a payload backwards along the
# computational graph
#
# Child classes that inherit from this class can add instance
# variables if additional caching is needed, and these need
# to be populated when writing the cached operation
abstract class Num::Grad::Gate(T)
  # Propogates an operation backwards, transforming a payload
  # and returning an array of Tensors
  abstract def backward(payload : Num::Grad::Payload(T)) : Array(T)

  # Caches the result of an operation on a context
